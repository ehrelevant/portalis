        <div class="text-md">
            The CS 195 experience can be informally divided into three main
            phases, Pre-Internship, During Internship, and Post-internship. The
            layout of the website slightly differs for each phase, depending on
            what is expected from its users.

                <div class="text-md pt-3 text-justify">
                    This phase, as its name suggests, describes the phase before
                    actual internships. During this phase, only students are
                    expected to submit any documents that need to be processed
                    before formally enrolling into the semester. Once student
                    documents have been approved, we move on to the next phase
                    of CS 195.

                <During /> During Internship
                <div class="text-md pt-3 text-justify">
                    During this phase, students should have been enrolled
                    already and have started their internship proper at their
                    respective companies. Students are expected to document
                    their weekly progress at their internships, through their
                    respective blog, following the instructions of the CS195
                    Faculty.
                    <br /> <br />
                    To assess student performance during their internships, each
                    internâ€™s supervisor is expected to submit reports regarding their
                    performance. If there are multiple interns under a single supervisor,
                    only one form needs to be filled out for all students under said
                    supervisor.

                    Closing off CS 195, this phase is dedicated to verifying and
                    assessing student performance after their internship has
                    been completed. Students are expected to fill up a
                    self-assessment form that lists their total number of hours
                    completed while their supervisor validates the information
                    the student has filled up.
